<p class="i2">His words don't speak scuttle or shilly-shally</p>
<p class="i2">"My 'sphere of influence' covers the Nile Valley."</p>
<p class="i2">Isn't that plain enough? God Ammon's nod</p>
<p class="i2">Was hardly more decisive. It is odd</p>
<p class="i2">How very like the Oracle's straight tip</p>

<p class="i2">I simply hold with the great Sire of History.</p>
<p class="i2">The <i>Times</i> and old <span class="sc">Herodotus</span> quite agree.</p>

<p class="i2">(At the French Press, at best, <i>I</i> am no sniffer),</p>

<h2 class="sans">SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE EDGWARE ROAD.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
<i>For over half a mile the pavement on the East side of the road is
thronged with promenaders, and the curbstone lined with stalls
and barrows, and hawkers of various wares. Marketing housewives
with covered baskets oscillate undecidedly from stalls to
shops, and put off purchasing to the last possible moment.
Maids-of-all-work perambulate arm in arm, exchanging airy
badinage with youths of their acquaintance, though the latter
seem to prefer the society of their own sex. A man with a
switchback skittle-board plays gloomy games by himself to an
unspeculative group of small boys. The tradesmen stand outside
their shops and conduct their business with a happy blend of
the methods of a travelling
showman and a clown.</i>

<p><i>A Crockery Merchant</i> (<i>as he

buyin' <i>common</i> things, you're
buyin' suthin' <i>good!</i> It 'appens
to be my buthday to-night, so
I'm goin' to let you people 'ave
the benefit of the doubt. Come on
'ere. I don't ask you to b'lieve
<i>me</i>&mdash;ony to jedge fur yerselves.
I'm not 'ere to tell you no fairy tales; and the reason why I'm in a
position to orfer up these vawses&mdash;all richly gilt, and decorated in
three colours, the most expensive ever made&mdash;the reason I'm able to
sell them so cheap as I'm doin' is this&mdash;(<i>he lowers his voice
mysteriously</i>)&mdash;arf
the stuff I 'ave 'ere we git <i>in very funny ways!</i></p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>This ingeniously suggestive hint enhances the natural charm of
his ware to such a degree that the vases are bought up
briskly, as calculated to brighten the humblest home.</i></p>

<p><i>A Sanctimonious Young Man</i> (<i>with a tongue too large for his
mouth, who has just succeeded in collecting a circle round him</i>). I
am only 'ere to-night, my friends, as a paid servant&mdash;for the purpose
of deciding a wager. Some o' you may have noticed an advertisement
lately in the <i>Daily Telegrawf</i>, asking for men to stand on Southwark
Bridge and orfer arf-suverings for a penny apiece. You are equally
well aware that it is illegal to orfer the Queen's coinage for money:
and that is <i>not</i> my intention this evening. <i>But</i> I 'ave 'ere several
pieces
of gold, guaranteed to be of the exact weight of arf a suvering, and
'all-marked, which, in order to decide the wager I 'ave spoken of, I
shall now perceed to charge you the sum of one penny for, and no
more. I am not allowed to sell <i>more</i> than one to each person&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>Here a constable comes up, and the decision of the wager is
postponed until a more favourable opportunity.</i></p>

<p><i>First "General"</i> (<i>looking into a draper's window</i>). Look at them
coloured felt 'ats&mdash;all shades, and on'y sixpence three-fardens!</p>

<p><i>Second "G."</i> They <i>are</i> reasonable;

<p><i>First Itinerant Physician</i> (<i>as

Frog in your Froat what I'm
doin' up now. I arsk you to try
it. It's given to me to give
away, and I'm goin' to <i>give</i> it
away&mdash;you understand?&mdash;that's
all. And now I'm goin' to tork
to you about suthink else. You
see this small bottle what I 'old
up. I tell you there's 'undreds
layin' in bed at this present
moment as 'ud give a shillin' fur
one of these&mdash;and I offer it to you
at one penny! It corrects all
nerve-pains connected with the
'ed, cures earache, toothache,
neuralgy, noomonia, 'art-complaint,
fits, an' syhatica. Each
bottle is charged with helectricity,
forming a complete galvanic-battery.
Hall <i>you</i> 'ave to do is to
place the bottle to one o' your
nawstrils, first closing the other
with your finger. You will find
it compels you to sniff. The
moment you <i>tyke</i> that sniff,
you'll find the worter comin'
into your heyes&mdash;and that's the
helectricity. You'll say, "<i>I</i> always
'eard helectricity was a

Very <i>likely!</i> You <i>'ave!</i> An'
<i>why?</i> Be-cawse o' the hignirant

<p><i>Lizerann.</i> Not <i>me</i>. I ain't got

<p><i>A Vendor of "'Ore'ound Tablets"</i> (<i>he is a voluble young man,

and a lassoo-soot as belonged to my Uncle <span class="sc">Bill</span>, doin' <i>wunnerful</i>

you, I don't deceive you; you may all on you do as well as me; on'y
you'll 'ave to git two good ref'rences fust, <i>and</i> belong to a temp'rance
society, like I do. This is the badge as I've got on me at this minnit.
I ain't always bin like I am now. I started business four year ago,
and was doin' wunnerful well, too, till I got among 'orse-copers an'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>
dealers and went on the booze, and lost the lot. Then I turned up
the drink and got a berth sellin' these 'ere Wangoo Tablets&mdash;and now
I've got a neat little missus, and a nice 'ome, goin' on wunnerful comfortable.
Never a week passes but what I buy myself something.
Last week it was a pair o' noo socks. Soon as the sun peeps out and
the doo dries up, I'm orf to Yarmouth. And what's the reason?
I've <i>enjoyed</i> myself there. My Uncle <span class="sc">Bill</span>, as lives at Lowestoft,
and keeps six fine 'orses and a light waggon, <i>he</i>'s doin' wunnerful
well, and he'd take me into partnership to-morrow, he would. But no&mdash;I'm
'appier as I am. What's the reason I kin go on torkin' to you
like this night after night, without injury to my voice? Shall I tell
yer? Because, every night o' my life, afore I go to bed, I take four
o' these Wangoo Tablets&mdash;compounded o' the purest 'erbs. You take
them to the nearest doctor's and arsk 'im to analyse an' test them as
he <i>will</i>, and you 'ear what <i>he</i> says of them! Take one o' them
tablets&mdash;after your pipe; after your cigaw; after your cigarette.
You won't want no more drink, you'll find they make you come 'ome
reglar every evening, and be able to buy a noo 'at every week.
You've ony to persevere for a bit with these 'ere lawzengers to be
like I am myself, doin' <i>wunnerful</i> well! You see this young feller
'ere? (<i>Indicating a sheepish head in a pot-hat which is visible over
the back of his stall.</i>) Born and bred in Kenada, <i>'e</i> was. And quite
<i>right!</i> Bin over 'ere six year, so o' course 'e speaks the lengwidge.
And <i>quite</i> right. Now I'm no Amerikin myself, but they're a
wunnerful clever people, the Amerikins are, allays inventin' or
suthink o' that there. And you're at liberty to go and arsk 'im for
yourselves whether this is a real Amerikin invention or not&mdash;as he'll
tell yer it <i>is</i>&mdash;and quite right, too! An' it stands to reason as
<i>he</i> orter to know, seein' he interdooced it 'imself and doin' wunnerful
well with it ever since. I ain't come 'ere to <i>rob</i> yer. Lady come and
give me a two-shillin' piece just now. I give it her back. <i>She</i>
didn't know&mdash;thort it was a penny, till I told her. Well, that just

of a Military Life</cite> (<span class="sc">Smith, Elder &amp; Co.</span>). Sir <span class="sc">John</span> has not
been in
a hurry. He began fighting more than forty years ago, and has since
filled up opportunity as it presented itself. These particular recollections
are chiefly occupied with the Crimean War and the Indian
Mutiny, though the old soldier has something to say about the
Afghan War of 1878-9, and the
Egyptian War of 1882. My
Baronite finds most interesting
the chapters about the Crimean
War, certain incidents and episodes
of which are narrated
with soldierlike directness and
simplicity. The story of the
Balaclava Charge has been told
in verse and prose innumerable
times. General <span class="sc">Adye</span> did not
actually see it, "a ridge of
intervening hills intercepting
the view" as he rode back to
the camp from Balaclava. But
he manages in a sentence or two
vividly to impress the scene on
the mind of the reader. Among many good stories is one about General
<span class="sc">Harry Jones</span>. <span class="sc">Pelissier</span>, with a Frenchman's scorn of any
language
but his own, got as near as he could to ordinary pronunciation when he
called him "General <span class="sc">Hairy-Joze</span>." He did better when the gallant
General was knighted, and was alluded to respectfully by the French
Commander-in-Chief as "<span class="sc">Sairey-Joze</span>" (Sir <span class="sc">Harry Jones</span>).</p>

<h3>THREE MODES OF SPENDING A BANK HOLIDAY.</h3>

<p class="title1">(<i>By a Confirmed Pessimist.</i>)</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Plan the First.</i>&mdash;Take to Volunteering. Be up at daybreak.
Leave your home after snatching a hasty breakfast of lukewarm tea
and stale bread-and-butter. Crowd into a railway-carriage, and
travel a hundred miles or so in the greatest discomfort. Fall in
with your company. March, counter-march, and stand at ease for
ten hours or so in sunshine, rain, fog, or snow. Stave off starvation
with a packet of sandwiches and a bottle of ginger ale. Dead
beat, enter crowded train a second time, and again travel a hundred
miles or so in the greatest discomfort. More dead than alive, stagger
home, and wearily roll into bed.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Plan the Second.</i>&mdash;Try a trip to the sea-side. Share a first-class
compartment with a dozen third-class passengers. Travel to
Shrimpington with the accompaniment of rank tobacco-smoke,
comic songs, and solos on the concertina. Get to your destination
with a splitting headache. Find that all the shops are shut,
and all the taverns open. Learn that Shrimpington, as represented
by its respectable inhabitants, goes away <i>en masse</i> on a bank
holiday. Discover that there is but one hotel in the place. Ascertain
that at the solitary hostelry the rooms are filled with noisy
excursionists, greedily devouring "the shilling tea." Search for
nourishment, and fail in your search. Fall back upon stale buns
at a third-rate sweet-stuff shop. Catch your train back, and endure
the torture of the morning. Travel amongst the same company,
under the like conditions. Reach home hours later than you proposed
on starting, and consider whether the holiday has been a triumphant
success or a dismal failure.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Plan the Third</i> (<i>highly recommended</i>).&mdash;Although desiring
change, remain at home, choosing the lesser of two evils.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Sanctum of the</i> Rédacteur en chef <i>of
"Le Gamin de Paris."</i> Rédacteur <i>discovered
reading latest issue</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Rédacteur.</i> Dear me, this note about the
pacific intentions of the <span class="sc">German Emperor</span> is
most interesting! I wonder how it got in. I
did not notice it when I glanced through the
pages. Still, I have the most unlimited confidence
in my staff. (<i>Quoting from his paper.</i>)
"There is no doubt that we can safely disarm,
as Germany is our friend&mdash;the best of our
friends." Dear me! Most interesting!</p>

<p class="rindent1">[<i>Enter menial, ushering in mysterious
stranger.</i></p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> I trust I am not intruding?</p>

<p><i>Rédacteur.</i> Certainly not. It is the duty
of an editor to be always at the service of
those who seek his advice. No doubt you
desire my opinion upon some matter of importance?</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> You have guessed rightly. Which
do you prefer, a mansion in town or a castle
in the country?</p>

<p><i>Rédacteur</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Well, I am scarcely
qualified to judge, for I only possess a mansion
in town. I have no castle in the country.</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> Pardon me. You have one now.</p>

<p class="rindent1">[<i>Gives</i> Editor <i>title-deeds</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rédacteur</i> (<i>glancing at the documents</i>).
What, the Château de St. Querecs! One of
the finest places in Brittany! You are really
too amiable!</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> Not at all. And now tell me,
do you prefer <span class="sc">Wagner</span> to <span class="sc">Verdi</span>, or <span class="sc">Mascagni</span>
to <span class="sc">Mozart</span>?</p>

<p><i>Rédacteur.</i> Again I am at a disadvantage.
You see I go so seldom to the Opera.
The expense is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> The expense is inconsiderable
when you possess a <i>loge</i> on the grand tier.
(<i>Giving paper.</i>) Allow me to present you
with a perpetual box.</p>

<p><i>Rédacteur.</i> Your courtesy is simply charming!
But why do you overwhelm me with
these obligations? We are unknown to one
another.</p>

<p><i>Stranger</i> (<i>with a bow</i>). Not at all. You
are famous. As for me&mdash;why I am nothing.
I am absolutely valueless.</p>

<p><i>Rédacteur</i> (<i>politely</i>). You do not do yourself
justice. I will be bound you are most
valuable.</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> Well, perhaps you are right.
At any rate I can fill in a cheque&mdash;yes, and
with four or five figures! I will show you.
Permit me.</p>

<p class="rindent1">[<i>Approaches writing materials, and
rapidly completes draft.</i></p>

<p><i>Rédacteur.</i> And for whom is that cheque?</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> Read the name to whose order it
is made payable.</p>

<p><i>Rédacteur</i> (<i>surprised but admiring</i>). Mine!
This is simply marvellous. And are you
clever enough to write a leader?</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> Assuredly. See I will compose
one at once. (<i>Sits at table, knocks off an
article and hands it to</i> Rédacteur). What do
you think of it?</p>

<p><i>Rédacteur</i> (<i>smiling</i>). I will give you my
opinion when I see it in type. You will find
it in the <i>Gamin</i> to-morrow. Good day!</p>

<h2>"TO PARIS AND BACK FOR NOTHING."</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>To the Editor of "Punch."</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;A most excellent institution, run on moral lines, has recently
been advertising "A tour on the Continent" for £5. This modest sum
is to cover travelling and hotel expenses, and no doubt has been
worked out on the most virtuous principles. In these days of rapid
progress, however, we can never stand still, and the question arises,
Cannot the holiday be cheapened? I contend it can, and as your
paper represents the human race in general and the British public in
particular, I desire to make known my discovery through your
columns. Of course "Trips for nothing"&mdash;the journeys I wish to
organise&mdash;cannot be managed without a little thought and arrangement.
For my purpose it is best not to insist too harshly upon the
importance of truth and honesty. After all, both these words represent
abstract ideas, that may be necessary for publication, but need not be
absolutely accepted as a guarantee of good faith.</p>

<p>Without further preface I jot down my programme. Say that a
would-be traveller without means desires to visit the Capital of
France gratuitously. I would have him present himself at the
Victoria Station garbed in the uniform of a guard. The necessary
costume, on application, would be supplied to him by one of the
agents of the Unprincipled Touring Company&mdash;the institution it is
my aim to establish. Just as the night mail was starting for Dover
he would enter the luggage-van, and then all would be clear until he
reached Paris. He would accompany the boxes and portmanteaus to
Calais, and be transferred (being registered) to the Chemin de Fer du
Nord, and remain undisturbed until he reached the terminus.</p>

<p>On coming out of the van he would be met by one of the agents of
the Unprincipled Touring Company, and be accused of being a spy.
This would immediately secure his arrest and safe custody in a
Parisian police-station. The agent, having played his part, would
disappear. It would now become the duty (and I trust the pleasure)
of the would-be traveller to look after himself without further
assistance. He would appeal to the British Ambassador. He would
tell his simple tale, how he had been drugged and conveyed in a state
of coma to the luggage-van; how he had no money, and had been
so affected by the narcotics, that his mind had become a perfect blank.
The British Minister would, doubtless, secure his release, and supply
him with funds. He would see some of the cheaper sights for which
Paris is celebrated, and then return home by an inexpensive route,
highly delighted with his adventures.</p>

<p>It will doubtless occur, in this practical age, to persons having even
the most moderate amount of brains, that hitherto the profits of the
Unprincipled Touring Company have remained unmentioned.
"Where do they come in?" will be the universal question. My
answer is simply, "Hush money." The would-be traveller, having
availed himself of the services of the proposed organisation, would,
for the remainder of his existence, be under an obligation to pay as
much as he could conveniently (or even inconveniently) spare to a
society which had secured for him so much semi-innocent recreation.</p>

<p>It may be advanced by ultra purists that the system of business
that would be inaugurated by the U. T. C. would be immoral. To
this I triumphantly reply, not more immoral than other systems in
full working order in many companies of the highest respectability
compatible with limited liability.</p>

<h3>WHICH IS THE CORRECT CARD?</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;"><a href="images/179a-330.png"><img src="images/179a-100.png" width="100" height="141" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>In <i>The Theatre</i>, a "review and magazine" most useful as well as
entertaining to all interested in the drama at home and abroad,
there appears, in the critical notice of what is just now successful on
the Parisian stage, a short account of a piece
called <i>M. le Directeur</i>. "<i>It is</i>," says the
writer, "<i>an amusing but not very savoury
skit upon the life of the petty official, and
the advantage taken by the head of a public
office to subserve his amorous propensities in
the management of his department and the
promotion of his subordinates</i>." Quite evident
from this what sort of a farcical comedy
it must be. This appears at p. 238. But at
p. 246, among "The Echoes from the Green
Room," we find that this piece, <i>M. le Directeur</i>,
which is at present "drawing all Paris
to the Vaudeville Theatre, is certainly one of
the most amusing plays," &amp;c. &amp;c., "<i>and it
depends for its success more upon genuine
humour and innocently comic incident than upon salaciousness of
situation or untranslatable wit</i>." Which of these accounts of the
same play is the correct one?</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 1.</i>&mdash;There is about <span class="sc">John Aird</span>
an artlessness of look and manner the price whereof is beyond rubies.
<span class="sc">Sark</span> fancies it is the beard that has much to do with it. When you
get a man light-hearted as a boy endowed with long grey beard, complications
certain to ensue. <span class="sc">Aird's</span> beard has precisely same preternaturally
proper look whether he is sitting in parish church listening
to sermon, or dancing a hornpipe on the white deck of the P. &amp; O.
<i>Caledonia</i>. Only he dances better than the average rector preaches.</p>

<p>Just the man to take part in the old Parliamentary game known as
asking friendly question. Usually played with Minister taking a
hand. If Treasury Bench wants to bring out some fact or appearance
of fact Whip gets Member on back bench to put question on
subject. Pretty to see Minister on such occasions; his startled look
on hearing himself addressed; his glance round to see if this is really
his hon. friend who is presuming to trouble him with what might be
awkward inquiry; then his slow, almost hesitating answer which
effectually corrects a calumny or nips a slander i' th' bud.</p>

<p>To-night, in view of pending division on second reading Welsh
Disestablishment Bill it was felt desirable to produce effect of overwhelming
national indignation at threatened spoliation of the Church.
Since Bill introduced petitions against it been dribbling in from
teeming population of English hamlets sternly saying This thing
shall not be. Apart from political importance of question, petitions
have peculiar interest as revealing existence of unknown clusters of
cottage homes. <span class="sc">Thomas Hardy</span> never invented such quaint, charming
names as the industry of compilers of petitions against this Bill
have brought to light. St. Dogmaels, St. Twynnel's, Pattiswick,
Neen Sollars, Chittlehamholt, Hampton Poyle. Woodeaton, Pawler's
Pury, Abbey Dore, Penwortham, Lillingstone Lovell, Crockham Hill,
Weston-under-Penyard, Itchen Stoke, Dunton Green&mdash;names musical
with the sound of church bells, sweet with the scent of newly mown
hay, the breath of cowslips.</p>

<p>This upheaval of the people on behalf of Mother Church loses its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>
effect by reason of ordinary procedure whereby petitions presented
at the Table are straightway thrust into a sack, and carted off to a
lumber room. Thing to do was to get Member to publicly inquire
from Chairman of Petitions Committee how the matter stood in the
ledger; how many petitions against Bill, how many in favour.
Who could do this better than <span class="sc">John Aird</span>? So he put question to
<span class="sc">Dalrymple</span>, and learned with dramatically ill-concealed surprise
that whilst over a thousand petitions against the Bill have poured in
on the House, not one had been received in its favour. It is true
that another question from opposite side of House brought out fact
that at least one of these State documents was result of labours of
wife of Clerk to Guardians of St. Asaph Union, who had been
instrumental in obtaining the unbiassed opinion of the resident
paupers on question at issue. But that a mere detail.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second Reading Welsh Disestablishment Bill
carried by majority of 44 in House of 564 Members. "<i>Clwych!
Clwych!</i>" roared <span class="sc">Mabon</span>, and was with difficulty restrained from
singing "<i>The March of the Men of Harlech</i>."</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Evidently in for another dull time. Welsh Disestablishment
Bill off, enter Irish Land Bill. Time precious; business pressing;
every quarter of hour worth a Chancellor of the Exchequer's
ransom. Ministers anxious above all things to get along with
business. <span class="sc">John Morley</span>, accordingly, sets useful example by delivering
speech an hour and twenty minutes long. This, as he mentioned,
followed upon exorbitant demands on patience of House
when he introduced the Bill. <span class="sc">Carson</span>, not to be outdone, certainly
not to be blamed, took up about as much time. Later came <span class="sc">St.
John Brodrick</span>, astonished at his own moderation in speaking for
only seventy minutes.</p>

<p>"This is not debating," <span class="sc">Sark</span> says. "It is just making speeches
by the yard. Hasn't the remotest effect upon the human mind, still
less upon deliberate action of House. Isn't even pretence of a fight;
second reading will be passed without division; Bill will go to
Committee in precisely same state as would have been the case had
it been read a second time before dinner, and Members spent rest of
evening in bosom of their families. Towards end of Session there will
be complaint of nothing done. At least Treasury Bench mustn't lift
up its voice in reproach at such conclusion. If right hon. gentlemen
set us such evil example, they mustn't complain if we follow it."</p>

<p>House in desolate state throughout spirit-sapping performance.
<span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> sat it all out. Contributed almost only token of life to
the dull monotony. In dangerously explosive state. If anybody
had sat on safety-valve would have burst to dead certainty. Happily
got off a few life-saving grunts and groans. Played sort of chorus to
<span class="sc">Carson's</span> speech and <span class="sc">Brodrick's</span> monologue. They severely
ignored
him&mdash;treatment which had no effect on his exuberance of spirits.</p>

<p>"Who are these Irish owners," <span class="sc">Brodrick</span> asked, looking severely
across table at <span class="sc">John Morley</span>, "who want to buy their tenants'
interest in order to sell it at a higher price?"</p>

<p>"I'll give you their names," cried <span class="sc">Tim</span>, after the fashion of the
naughty boy safe at the outer edge of a crowd.</p>

<p>"I defy the right hon.
gentleman to produce a
single instance," <span class="sc">Brodrick</span>
continued, taking no notice
of <span class="sc">Tim</span>.</p>

<p>"I'll give you half a
dozen," shouted <span class="sc">Tim</span>, ever
ready to oblige, though
leaving it in doubt whether
the half dozen he offered
were lashes or other instances.
Then the policeman,
in shape of <span class="sc">Speaker</span>,
appeared on scene, and for
awhile there was silence on
the back benches, and dullness
regained its sway.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second
Reading Irish Land Bill
moved.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/180a-540.png"><img src="images/180a-150.png" width="150" height="204" alt="Campbell-Bannerman and his National" /></a>
<p>Campbell-Bannerman and his National
Emblem (Unsuited to the Convenience of
a Button-hole).</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Thursday.</span>&mdash;For illustration of soft answer that
turneth away wrath, <span class="sc">Cawmel-Bannerman's</span>
reply just now on the shamrock incident perfect in its way.
The heart of Ireland stirred by fresh stories of how her
sons, turning up on parade on St. Patrick's Day proudly wearing
shamrock, were ordered by brutal Saxon officers to "fling it on the
ground." <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> had cases brought under his notice. Never
do for this branch of United Ireland to appear as sole champion of
national rights in this matter. So wearisome <span class="sc">Willie Redmond</span>
swaggers on scene with another case.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a href="images/180b-700.png"><img src="images/180b-200.png" width="200" height="308" alt="T. W. Russell between Landlord and Tenant." /></a>
<p>T. W. Russell between Landlord and Tenant.</p></div>

<p>A delicate subject for <span class="sc">Secretary of State for War</span> to handle.
On one hand, discipline must be maintained. On the other, national
sentiment must not be affronted, especially when represented
in House by sufficient votes to turn the scale in
any division. <span class="sc">Cawmel-Bannerman</span> not only said right
thing, but said it in right way. "I myself," he murmured
with prettily apologetic air, "stand in a somewhat neutral position,
because I belong to a country whose national emblem does not
lend itself to the convenience of the button-hole."</p>

<p>House laughed at idea of <span class="sc">Cawmel-Bannerman</span>
bustling in on St. Andrew's Day with bunch of thistles
in his button-hole. With the laugh the battle was won;
what might have been in less skilful hands an awkward
incident passed off amid genial laughter.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Still explaining why we are not going
to oppose Second Reading Irish Land Bill, though we regard it as
most revolutionary and dangerous measure of recent times.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Second reading Irish Land Bill through at last. Passed
stage without division, which seems odd considering apprehension
with which Opposition regard it. Situation largely due to <span class="sc">Boanerges
Russell</span>, one of few men who understand Bill. Explained it in
luminous speech, like some others thrown away on scanty audience.
<span class="sc">Boanerges</span> later indicated his impartial attitude by seating himself
between landlord and tenant, represented by <span class="sc">Joseph</span> of Birmingham
and son <span class="sc">Austen</span>. <span class="sc">Joe</span> incidentally mentions he has only one
tenant, that is <span class="sc">Austen</span>, "who," he added, with plaintive note,
which found echo with the Irish landlords, "pays no rent, and is
always coming down on me for compensation."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Irish Land Bill read second time.</p>

<h3>LITERARY "FOOD AND FEEDING."</h3>

<p class="ind">The present generation affirms that it cannot away with <i>Pickwick</i>,
and is not attracted by <i>Vanity Fair</i>. The balance of modern
opinion would be rather in favour of <span class="sc">Thackeray</span> than of
<span class="sc">Dickens</span>.
Take, for example, the two works already quoted, <i>Pickwick</i> and
<cite>Vanity Fair</cite>. A common modern objection made to <cite>Pickwick</cite> is,
that the characters in <i>Pickwick</i> are perpetually guttling or imbibing,
or both simultaneously. This is, to a certain extent, true. But how
about <span class="sc">Thackeray's</span> characters in <cite>Vanity Fair?</cite> A careful student
has sent us a list of the numerous eatings and drinkings in both
novels. In <cite>Pickwick</cite>, reckoning from the brandy-and-water partaken
of by <i>Mr. Jingle</i>, at the Pickwickians' expense, after the scene
with the pugnacious hackney-coachman, and finishing with the
breakfast that celebrated the marriage of <i>Mr. Snodgrass</i> with <i>Miss
Emily Wardle</i>, there are exactly (so we are informed) one hundred
and one instances of drinking and eating; some of them being of
drinking only, unqualified.</p>

<p class="ind">In <cite>Vanity Fair</cite>, from the introduction of <i>Miss Pinkerton's</i>
"seed cake," to <i>Becky</i> taking <i>Amelia</i> a cup of tea, <i>vide</i>
chapter
sixty-seven, we learn, on the same authority, that there are one
hundred and fifteen cases "allowed for refreshment" in some form
or other.</p>

<p class="ind">A collection of the meals of heroes and heroines in the most popular
works of fiction, and <i>menus</i> compiled therefrom, might be found
interesting, especially if carefully criticised by Sir <span class="sc">Henry Thompson</span>
in a separate chapter to be added to the next edition of his really
invaluable work, namely, <i>Food and Feeding</i>. Do the modern
novelists feed their characters as plentifully as did <span class="sc">Dickens</span> and
<span class="sc">Thackeray</span> theirs? Be this as it may, these two great Twin
Brethren&mdash;so utterly dissimilar in every thing except in the possession
of the gift of genius&mdash;fed their readers well and bountifully.</p>
